Tar File Contexts:
(1) simpsh.c - source file of the Simpleton Shell implementation
(2) Makefile - creates the executable simpsh and tar file
(3) README - known limitations and extra features
(4) script - contains the smoke test cases

I had diffculty implementing command and there were many ummentioned exceptions 
that I was not quite sure how to handle, but the TA said if it is not explicity 
mentioned in the specs then I do not have to deal with it. I had trouble with a 
segmentation fault for case 2 but I added {0,0,0,0} to the end of the struct I 
passed in. This solved the problem but I am not exactly sure why. 

Test cases:
I checked that invalid arguments and valid arguments exited with the correct codes.
I also made sure that mutiple command options and multiple arguments to command
options worked as needed.
