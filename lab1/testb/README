Tar File Contexts:
(1) simpsh.c - source file of the Simpleton Shell implementation
(2) Makefile - creates the executable simpsh and tar file
(3) README - known limitations and extra features
(4) script - contains the smoke test cases

Possible bugs:
I was failing test case 27 so I wrote a separate script for it testing each part
of the if statement. I found out that it was failing at the exit code == 1 line
so I printed out the exit code it was exiting with, which was also 1. I was very
confused why it was failing when the exit code was also 1 and at one point commented
out the sleep(1) right above it. I ran the script again and it passed the check.
After uncommenting the sleep(1), the script passed again so I was not sure
what caused it to fail in the first place and why it starting working after.

I had diffculty implementing command and there were many ummentioned exceptions 
that I was not quite sure how to handle, but the TA said if it is not explicity 
mentioned in the specs then I do not have to deal with it. I had trouble with a 
segmentation fault for case 2 but I added {0,0,0,0} to the end of the struct I 
passed in and fixed the problem. 

Test cases:
I checked that invalid arguments and valid arguments exited with the correct codes.
I also made sure that mutiple command options and multiple arguments to command
options worked as needed. I did some basic checking for file descriptor flags create
and excl and also checked abort, ignore, default. I checked simple cases of chdir and
wait.
