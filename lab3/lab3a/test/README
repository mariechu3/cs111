(1) Makefile - contains targets lab3a, dist, and clean to create the executable
and tar file and delete all programs and output generated by the Makefile
(2) README - Contains descriptions of each of the included files and any other
information
(3) lab3a.c - Source code of generating the required summaries 
(4) ext2_fs.h - simplified version of the Linux header file that defines the
format of the EXT2 file system

I looked at the gnu page for the ext2 filesystem that gave a summary of the
file system itself, the layout, and breakdown of each element in the file
system. I tackled the assignment one requirement at a time and checked with
a grep and diff on each element we were supposed to print out with the trivial
case. There are no limitations that I am aware of.
