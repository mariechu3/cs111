(1) Makefile - contains targets build, dist, and clean to link the "executable"
and tar file and delete all programs and output generated by the Makefile
(2) README - Contains descriptions of each of the included files and any other
information
(3) lab3b.py - Source code of analysing and printing csv of file systems. 

I tested with the trivial.csv one output at a time to make sure it had the 
correct behavior. I would change a line in the csv to invoke unallocated 
inodes, pointing to the wrong current directory, etc. There were many edge
cases that I was not completely sure how to deal with and tried my best to
model the behavior based off of the sanity script and original unmodified csv
outputs. For examples, I was unsure if I had 24 inodes would the total inodes
include inode 0 or not. My script does not have any limitations that I am 
aware of.
